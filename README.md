# Metric Dimension
This repository contains code for checking whether a subset of vertices resolves a graph.

## Background

### Metric dimension

### Graphs of interest

## Running the code
The code is written in Sage. The simplest way to run it is by copy-pasting the contents of `filename` into [SageMathCell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/). If you want to run larger examples, which may take longer, it is recommended to use Sage in [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) or install [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) on your computer.
